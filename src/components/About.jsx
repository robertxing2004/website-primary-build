              I'm currently in third year at Western University studying<br/>
              software engineering and business, pursuing the Ivey HBA<br/>
              dual degree program.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from school and work, I enjoy travelling all over the world and<br/>
              taking lots of photos! I also have a huge love for aviation, and I hope<br/>
              to get my Canadian private pilot's license in the (hopefully) near future.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm looking to pursue a career in tech, and I'm mainly interested in<br/>
              fullstack development, embedded systems, and project management.<br/>
              At the moment I'm looking for summer (May-August) co-op and internship <br/>opportunities.
